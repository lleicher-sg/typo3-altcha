## üß© Customizing Altcha Widget Texts

You can customize the texts displayed by the Altcha widget (e.g., for translation) by overriding the `AltchaTranslations.html` partial.

### üõ† 1. Create Your Own Partial

Create a new file at the following location in your extension or site package:

```
EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Frontend/Partials/AltchaTranslations.html
```

Replace `my_extension` with the key of your sitepackage or custom extension.

### üõ† 2. Add YAML Configuration to Register Partial Path

To let TYPO3 know about your new partial path, extend the YAML configuration of the Form Framework. In your sitepackage, add the following file:

**`Configuration/Form/Overrides/form_editor.yaml`**

```yaml
TYPO3:
  CMS:
    Form:
      prototypes:
        standard:
          renderingOptions:
            partialRootPaths:
              20: 'EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Frontend/Partials/'
```

> Your YAML file must be included in TypoScript with a key **higher than the one used by this extension (e.g. > 125)** to ensure it overrides the default path.

In your TypoScript setup:

```typoscript
plugin.tx_form.settings.yamlConfigurations {
    125 = EXT:altcha/Configuration/Yaml/FormSetup.yaml
    200 = EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Form/Overrides/form_editor.yaml
}
```

This ensures that your own YAML is loaded **after** the one provided by Altcha.

### üî§ Available Translation Keys

You can define any of the following keys inside your `AltchaTranslations.html`:

* `ariaLinkLabel`
* `enterCode`
* `enterCodeAria`
* `error`
* `expired`
* `footer`
* `getAudioChallenge`
* `label`
* `loading`
* `reload`
* `verify`
* `verificationRequired`
* `verified`
* `verifying`
* `waitAlert`

### ‚úÖ Example with Static Texts

**`EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Frontend/Partials/AltchaTranslations.html`:**

```html
<f:spaceless>
    <f:format.json value="{
        label: 'I am not a robot',
        verified: 'Verified',
        verifying: 'Verifying'
    }" />
</f:spaceless>
```

---

### üåê Example with TYPO3 Localization

If you want to use TYPO3‚Äôs localization, add the relevant labels to your `locallang.xlf`.

**Partial Example:**

```html
<f:spaceless>
    <f:format.json value="{
        ariaLinkLabel: f:translate(key: 'altcha.ariaLinkLabel', extensionName: 'my_extension'),
        error: f:translate(key: 'altcha.error', extensionName: 'my_extension'),
        verified: f:translate(key: 'altcha.verified', extensionName: 'my_extension')
    }" />
</f:spaceless>
```
